# Goatmotion Studios Website Project


## Description
### The GoatMotion website development has been one of my favorite projects to work on. I invested a significant amount of time in designing the website layout in Figma during my UX class, meticulously crafting each element to create a seamless user experience. This design phase was crucial in shaping the project, allowing me to explore various layout options and user interactions. Transitioning from design to development presented its own set of challenges. Coding the website required me to learn and apply new technologies, pushing me to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although the project is still a work in progress, with more JavaScript functionality to be added, the journey so far has been incredibly rewarding. Each step has provided valuable lessons in both design and development, making this project a true learning experience.

## Process, Challenges, and Lessons Learned
- I began the GoatMotion website development by first designing the desktop version, which involved laying out the HTML structure step by step. As I progressed, I simultaneously worked on the CSS, making adjustments to the HTML as necessary to ensure everything aligned perfectly with my design vision.

- One of the significant challenges I faced was designing certain elements and ensuring the website was fully responsive across different devices. Tackling the responsive design required extra effort and careful attention to detail, but it was a crucial learning experience. Additionally, I created a hamburger menu for the first time, which was both challenging and exciting. To overcome this, I sought guidance from YouTube tutorials, which helped me implement the menu successfully.

- Throughout this project, I learned the importance of patience. There were moments of frustration, especially when things didn’t work as expected, but pushing through those challenges was incredibly rewarding. I’m now eager to learn JavaScript to complete the remaining parts of the project, and I feel confident in my ability to tackle any website design I set my mind to. This project not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the value of perseverance in the face of obstacles.
